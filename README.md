# AutoStore Workflows

## Overview

Welcome to (what I believe), is the first Open Source AutoStore community on GitHub (and anywhere)!

My name is Nick Caruso, and I'm the president of Visiyo LLC, a software development and integration company.  Among our many developers and integrators are several people with NSi/Nuance AutoStore experience.

We decided to create one repo with a collection of all of our sample CFGs, scripts, best practices, etc.  And to share that with the community of customers, partners, and users of AutoStore.  We're starting with just two, but we'll add probably one per week.

Most importantly, I encourage you to post questions here: https://github.com/visiyo/AutostoreWorkflows/issues, and also to send us your own CFGs and scripts so we can add them to the repo.
